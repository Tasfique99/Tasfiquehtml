      <h2>About Kushtia</h2>
      <p>
        Kushtia is a beautiful city located on the banks of the Gorai River in Bangladesh. It is known as the cultural capital of Bangladesh, famous for its unique sweets like Tiler Khaja and Kulfi Malai.
      </p>
      <p>
        The city has a rich history, with its municipality established back in 1869. Kushtia grew quickly thanks to the railway station and industries like Mohini Mill that started in the 19th century.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Kushtia continues to thrive with many industries contributing to the national economy while preserving its cultural heritage, including the Mausoleum of Lalon Shah.
