      <h2>My Programming Journey</h2>
      <p>
        My goal is to become a skilled and confident software developer. I want to build software that solves real-world problems and helps people in meaningful ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am constantly learning â€” from front-end web development to backend logic and databases. Every day, I aim to be better than I was yesterday.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also want to collaborate with others, work on real-life projects, and eventually contribute to open-source communities that support the tech world.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Master multiple programming languages</li>
        <li>Build real-world applications</li>
        <li>Keep learning every day</li>
      </ul>
